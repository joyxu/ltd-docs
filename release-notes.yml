      - name: Zephyr
        manifest_project: zephyr
        features:
          - heading: ADC for mcux
            summary: |
              An ADC driver for mcux devices was merged, and support
              for it was enabled for several boards.
          - heading: Boards
            summary: |
              Board support was added for the VBLUno52 and VBLUno51,
              based on nRF5 SoCs, and STM32F3DISCOVERY.
          - heading: Bluetooth Mesh
            summary: |
              An initial implementation of the newly-release Bluetooth
              Mesh specification was merged, with samples for some
              nRF52-based boards.
          - heading: Device tree
            summary: |
              The push to improve device tree usage
              continues. Formerly Kconfig-based configuration for I2C
              drivers was moved to DT, with uses in mcux and stm32
              drivers. The Bluetooth UART configuration also now is
              generated from DT. On STM32 targets, there is now an rcc
              node, and the DTSIs have been refactored to reflect
              inheritance among SoCs. The UART device which has the
              console attached is now available from DT on supported
              targets. Other DT improvements were merged as well.
          - heading: Device drivers for STM32
            summary: |
              Various device drivers were added for STM32 targets.

              A HAL-based Ethernet peripheral driver, I2C, SPI, and
              RNG (random number generator).
          - heading: Device drivers for NXP KW40Z
            summary: |
              IEEE 802.15.4 support was added for NXP KW40Z targets.
          - heading: Flash partitions added
            summary: |
              Flash partition support needed by mcuboot was added for
              more boards (96b_carbon, 96b_nitrogen, disco_l475_iot1,
              nrf52840_pca10056, and nucleo_f401re).
          - heading: Flash and Bluetooth driver safety for nRF
            summary: |
              Support for safe simultaneous usage of the Flash and
              Bluetooth drivers on nRF devices was merged.
          - heading: OpenSDA support for NXP boards
            summary: |
              Several NXP boards now select flash and debugging
              scripts based on the OpenSDA debug adapter provided by
              the SoC vendor.
          - heading: Socket poll()
            summary: |
              The BSD-like sockets API received support for the poll()
              I/O multiplexing operation.
          - heading: Python, and pip, version 3
            summary: |
              All dependencies for support scripts are now recommended
              to be installed using pip3.
          - heading: pyelftools dependency
            summary: |
              Zephyr now depends on the pyelftools package to build
              images.
          - heading: Memory management and protection
            summary: |
              Various improvements to how Zephyr manages and protects
              memory have been made.

              The application and kernel memory areas are now placed
              into different linker sections. This will enable memory
              protection of the kernel from the application.

              MMU support on QEMU for x86 is enabled by default.

              Generic support was added for marking variable
              declarations as belonging to kernel memory, along with
              architecture-specific support for x86.

              Stack guard pages have been added for x86 targets.
          - heading: TCP backlog
            summary: |
              A global TCP backlog for multiple incoming connections
              on the same port was added, along with the usual number
              of networking fixes and improvements. A number of
              Bluetooth fixes were merged as well.
        bug_fixes:
          - heading: Self-test suite improvements
            summary: |
              Various improvements and fixes were merged to the Zephyr
              self-test suite, as efforts continue to unify test
              project configuration files and better apply filtering
              when selecting tests to run.
          - heading: Bluetooth fixes
            summary: |
              A variety of important Bluetooth fixes were merged, which
